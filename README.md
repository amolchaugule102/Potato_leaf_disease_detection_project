# Potato_leaf_disease_detection_project
This project focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to detect and classify various diseases affecting potato leaves. By analyzing images of potato leaves, the model can identify symptoms of common diseases such as late blight, early blight etc.

Features :<br>
Image Preprocessing: Converts raw images into a suitable format for analysis.<br>

Model Training: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train the model on labeled datasets of potato leaf images.<br>

Disease Classification: Accurately classifies different types of diseases based on visual symptoms.<br>

User Interface: A simple web interface for users to upload images and receive disease diagnosis and recommendations.<br>
